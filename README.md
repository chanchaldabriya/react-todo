This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using its **typescript**  template.

# Description
A simple React Todo application written in typescript along with todos persistent as stored in localstorage of browser.
The implementation includes extensive use of **React hooks** in its components and also using some **custom hooks** to extend the features reusability.
Unit test cases for the components are written using **jest** & **enzyme**.

# Usage
Download or clone the repository.
Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

To run the app use the script provided by "create-react-app" package as follows:
### `npm start`

To run the test cases, use the script provided by "create-react-app" package as follows:
### `npm test`

# Future scope
* Feature like **deletion of todos** from the list & if taking it even further have access to **recently deleted items list with ability to restore todos** can be a great utility of this app in future.
* Presence of field like **deadline date & notifications** to user before deadline can also be a handy feature for the user to manage tasks more effectively.
* **Sharing/Assigning of todos** to other users(if added multiuser support with login) can be the next raw idea.   
*Example scenario - A non-working homemaker woman summing up the grocery & household items and sharing the list to her husband to collect those items from the market.*
